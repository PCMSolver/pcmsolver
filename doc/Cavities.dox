/** \page Cavities Cavity generators

We will here describe the inheritance hierarchy for generating cavities, in order to use and extend it properly.
The runtime creation of cavity objects relies on the Factory Method pattern \cite Gamma1994, \cite Alexandrescu2001, 
implemented through the CavityFactory class.
