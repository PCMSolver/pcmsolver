/** \page Testing Testing
We perform unit testing of our API. The unit testing framework used is
[Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) The framework provides quite an
extensive set of macros to test various data types, it also provides facilities
for easily setting up test fixtures.  Usage is extremely simple and the
[documentation](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/Readme.md)
is very well written.  For a quick primer on how to use Boost Test look
[here](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md)
The basic idea of unit testing is to test each building block of the code
separataly. In our case, the term "building block" is used to mean a class.

To add new tests for your class you have to:
	-# create a new subdirectory inside tests/ and add a line like the following
	to the CMakeLists.txt
	\code
	add_subdirectory(new_subdir)
	\endcode
	-# create a CMakeLists.txt inside your new subdirectory.
    This CMakeLists.txt adds the source for a given unit test to the global `TestSources`
    property and notifies CTest that a test with given name is part of the test suite.
    \code
    set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY TestSources ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/testname.cpp)
    add_test(NAME testname COMMAND unit_tests.x [testname])
    \endcode
	We require that each source file containing tests follows the naming convention
	new_subdir_testname and that testname gives some clue to what is being tested.
    Notice the use of square brackets in the `add_test` macro in the `COMMAND` argument.
    Catch uses tags to index tests and tags are surrounded by square brackets.
	Depending on the execution of tests in a different subdirectory is bad practice.
	A possible workaround is to add some kind of input file and create a text fixture
	that sets up the test environment. Have a look in the `tests/input` directory
    for an example
	-# create the .cpp files containing the tests. Use the following template:
	\include snippets/test_example.cpp
	In this example we are creating a test fixture. The fixture will instatiate
	a GePolCavity with fixed parameters. The result is then tested against reference values
    in the various SECTIONs.
	It is **important** to add the documentation lines on top of the tests, to help other
	developers understand which class is being tested and what parameters are being tested.
    Within Catch fixtures are created behind the curtains, you do not need to worry about
    those details. This results in somewhat terser test source files.
