Maintenance
===========

Description and how-to for maintenance operations.
Some of the maintenance scripts have been moved to the `pcmsolvermeta
repository <https://gitlab.com/PCMSolver/pcmsolvermeta>`_

Branching Model and Release Process
-----------------------------------

.. warning::
   **Incomplete or outdated information!**

Releases in a ``X.Y.Z`` series are annotated tags on the corresponding branch.

Pull Request Requirements
-------------------------

The project is integrated with `Danger.Systems <http://danger.systems/ruby/>`_.
On each PR, one CI job will run the integration and a `bot <https://github.com/minazobot>`_ will
report which requirements are **not met** in your PR.
These reports can be _warnings_ and _errors_. You will discuss and solve both
of them with the reviewers.
The automatic rules are laid out in the ``Dangerfile`` and are used to enforce an
adequate level of testing, documentation and code quality.

Danger.Systems Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- PRs classed as Work in Progress.
- Codebase was modified, but no tests were added.
- Nontrivial changes to the codebase, but no documentation added.
- Codebase was modified, but ``CHANGELOG.md`` was not updated.
- Source files were added or removed, but ``.gitattributes`` was not updated.

Danger.Systems Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Commit message linting, based on some of `these recommendations <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`_:
  - Commit subject is more than one word.
  - Commit subject is no longer than 50 characters.
  - Commit subject and body are separated by an empty line.

- Clean commit history, without merge commits.

- Code style for ``.hpp``, ``.cpp``, ``.h`` files follows the conventions in
  ``.clang-format``.

- Code style for ``.py`` files follows the conventions in ``.style.yapf``.

Updating the Danger Bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bot reports results from running the `Danger.System ruby gem
<http://danger.systems/ruby/>`_. From time to time, it is necessary to update
the ``Gemfile`` and ``Gemfile.lock``:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd .ci
   bundle update
   bundle install

The last command can also be ru outside of the ``.ci`` folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   bundle install --gemfile=.ci/Gemfile

Minting a new release
=====================

1. Version numbering follows the guidelines of `semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_
   To update, change the relevant field in the ``README.md`` file.
2. Tidy up ``CHANGELOG.md``. This includes:
   a. Making sure that the topmost header is the new version number, with the
   correct release date.
   b. Making sure that the links at the bottom of the document are correct.
3. Run ``git shortlog -sn`` and check that the all authors are listed in
   ``AUTHORS.md``.
4. Update the version number in the citation snippet in
   ``doc/snippets/citation.bib``.
5. Commit your changes and push.
6. If CI was happy, you can tag a new release. For example for ``v1.1.12``:

   .. code-block:: bash

    git tag -a v1.1.12 -m "Version 1.1.12 released"
7. Head over to GitHub and add a short release description in `web UI <https://github.com/PCMSolver/pcmsolver/releases>`_.
8. As a final step, get the release DOI from `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_. File a pull request on
   GitHub to update the Zenodo badge in ``README.md``.

Changelog
=========

We follow the guidelines of `Keep a CHANGELOG <http://keepachangelog.com/>`_
On all **but** the release branches, there is an ``Unreleased`` section
under which new additions should be listed.
To simplify perusal of the ``CHANGELOG.md``, use the following subsections:

1. ``Added`` for new features.
2. ``Changed`` for changes in existing functionality.
3. ``Deprecated`` for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
4. ``Removed`` for deprecated features removed in this release.
5. ``Fixed`` for any bug fixes.
6. ``Security`` to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.

Updating Eigen Distribution
===========================

The C++ linear algebra library Eigen comes bundled with the module. To update
the distributed version one has to:

1. download the desired version of the library to a scratch location. Eigen's
   website is: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
2. unpack the downloaded archive;
3. go into the newly created directory and create a build directory;
4. go into the newly created build directory and type the following (remember
   to substitute @PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@ with the actual path)

   .. code-block:: bash

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=@PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@/external/eigen3

Remember to commit and push your modifications.

Git Pre-Commit Hooks
====================

[Git pre-commit hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/gr/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) are used to
keep track of code style and license header in source files.
Code style is checked using ``clang-format``.

.. warning::
   **You need to install ``clang-format`` (v3.9 recommended) to run the code style validation hook!**

License headers are checked using the ``license_maintainer.py`` script and the
header templates for the different languages used in this project.
The Python script checks the ``.gitattributes`` file to determine which license
headers need to be maintained and in which files:

.. code-block:: bash

   src/pedra/pedra_dlapack.F90 !licensefile
   src/solver/*.hpp licensefile=.githooks/LICENSE-C++

The first line specifies that the file in ``src/pedra/pedra_dlapack.F90`` should
not be touched, while the second line states that all ``.hpp`` files in ``src/solver``
should get an header from the template in ``.githooks/LICENSE-C++``
Location of files in ``.gitattributes`` are always specified with respect
to the project root directory.

The hooks are located in the ``.githooks`` subdirectory and **have to be installed by hand**
whenever you clone the repository anew:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd .git/hooks
   cp --symbolic-link ../../.githooks/* .

Installed hooks will **always** be executed. Use ``git commit --no-verify`` to
bypass explicitly the hooks.
