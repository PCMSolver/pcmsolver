Interfacing a QM program and PCMSolver
======================================

.. warning::

   **Work in Progress!!**

How PCMSolver handles potentials and charges: surface functions
---------------------------------------------------------------

:cpp:class:`SurfaceFunction`

What you should care about: API functions
-----------------------------------------

These are the contents of the ``pcmsolver.h`` file defining
the public API of the PCMSolver library. The Fortran bindings
for the API are in the ``pcmsolver.F90`` file.
The indexing of symmetry operations and their mapping to a bitstring
is explained in the following table. This is important when passing
symmetry information to the :cpp:func:`pcmsolver_new` function.

.. _symmetry-ops:
