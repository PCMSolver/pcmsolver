 *  \brief IEFPCM, collocation-based solver
 *  \author Luca Frediani, Roberto Di Remigio
 *  \date 2011, 2015, 2016
 *
 *  \note We store the non-Hermitian, symmetry-blocked T(epsilon) and Rinfinity matrices.
 *  The ASC is obtained by multiplying the MEP by Rinfinity and then using a partially
 *  pivoted LU decomposition of T(epsilon) on the resulting vector.
 *  In case the polarization weights are requested, we use the approach suggested in
 *  \cite Barone2004-ae.
 *  First, the adjoint problem is solved:
 *  \f[
 *      \mathbf{T}_\varepsilon^\dagger \tilde{v} = v
 *  \f]
 *  Also in this case a partially pivoted LU decomposition is used.
 *  The "transposed" ASC is obtained by the matrix-vector multiplication:
 *  \f[
 *      q^* = \mathbf{R}_\infty^\dagger \tilde{v}
 *  \f]
 *  Eventually, the two sets of charges are summed and divided by 2
 *  This avoids computing and storing the inverse explicitly, at the expense of storing
 *  both T(epsilon) and Rinfinity.
